Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution from Microsoft. It is designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and respond to threats in real-time, providing a comprehensive security operations platform.
