# Log Analytic Workspace

Log Analytics is a service in Azure Monitor that enables you to collect, search, and analyze log data from various sources, including Azure resources, on-premises environments, and other cloud providers. It provides a centralized platform for monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing the performance and security of your applications and infrastructure. 

In this project we will use this tool to ingest logs from the virtual machine and create our own custom logs that have the geographic information so that we can discover from where the attackers are coming from. 

## Setting up Log Analytics Workspace on Azure
